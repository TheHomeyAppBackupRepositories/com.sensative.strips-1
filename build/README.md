Getting Started
---------------
If you haven't already installed the Homey CLI, do that first:

    npm i -g homey

After that, running the app on your Homey is easy:

    npm i
    npm start

Of course, you're free to call `homey app run` manually, but you may have to copy the `app.json` from the `.homeycompose` folder once before being able to run the application.
